User Stories: 

As a User(of the program), I want to get the Input records sheet, So that I can compute the daily wake-up hours of the GuardsAs a User(of the program), I want to get the Input records sheet, So that I can compute the daily sleeping hours of the Guards  

As a User(of the program), I want to get the Input records sheet, So that I can compute the Guard who sleeps the most

As a User(of the program), I want to get the Input records sheet, So that I can compute the Guard who awake the most  

As a User(of the program), I want to get the Input records sheet, So that I can compute the average sleeping time of a Guard

Note: Marking each an every task as individual to achieve the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small , Testable) principle for a good user story

Acceptance Criterias:
Given a begin shift time for a guard,
When I compute the daily wake-up hours for that guard,
Then add the wake-up hours counter for that guard with the computed wake-up hours

Given a asleep time for a guard,
When I compute the daily sleep hours for that guard,
Then add the sleep hours counter for that guard with the computed sleep hours

Given a wake up time for a guard,
When I compute the daily wake-up hours for that guard,
Then add the wake-up hours counter for that guard with the computed wake-up hours

Given the final computed sleephours for each and every guardWhen I compute the duration for every guard's overall daily sleep hoursThen show the computed sleep hours for every guard
Given the final computed wakeup hours for each and every guardWhen I compute the duration for every guard's overall daily wakeup hours Then show the computed wakeup hours for every guard
Given the final computed wakeup hours for each and every guardWhen I compute  which guard awake the mostThen show the computed guard number who awake the most
Given the final computed sleep hours for each and every guardWhen I compute which guard sleeps  the mostThen show the computed guard number who sleeps the most
Given the final computed sleep hours for each and every guardWhen I compute the average sleeping time of a guardThen show the computed average sleeping time of a guard
Given some INVALID_INPUTWhen I compute ANYTHINGThen show the ERRO_INVALID INPUT
